# The Artificial Murine Multiple Sclerosis simulation (ARTIMMUS)

This is an agent-based model of the mouse autoimmune disease Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. 
It was built for the purpose of understanding the immune cell interactions that lead to spontaneous recovery of these mice from induced disease. 

The project was created during my PhD at the University of York, 2007-2011, and lead to multiple publications (below).

It is coded in Java, with bits of Matlab, python and ruby code for subsequent analysis (I was interested in learning new languages at the time). 

For purely historic reasons of how the project was coded, many of the analysis scripts shipped herein require that the code be held within a directory named "Treg_2D". 
If you don't adhere to this then be prepared to either 1) lose some analytical functionality or 2) go and change all the concerned scripts. This mainly concerns the scripts that handle sensitivity analysis. 

I will try to help you as I can, please get in touch if you have questions. 
However, please note that I haven't worked on this years now, and have no plans to do so again soon (too many other exciting projects taking my time these days).
